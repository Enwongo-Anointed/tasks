            There are indeed many questions I would love to ask whoever, just whoever can give reasonable answers
            and yet still stand by to provide guidance. Let your replies be what you can help me accomplish not just fairytales
            or things out of textbooks. Do this for me if you would, pretty please.

                This question sounds as though you regret learning it. Leaving a life with minimal regrets is a desire of life,
                of mine. They say the mechanical engineering field grows quite speedily. You never know what would fall under
                mechanical engineering practice tommorow. Also, as an added advantage, it is a cash cow, a ready source of
                income for the time being- see it as that.

                While there exists many reasons to feel regret, I would give No as the answer for the reason being that <em>no
                knowledge gained is lost</em>. So rather than regret it, put effort into it while it lasts and see it as an extra skill
                gained in your life pursuits. By function of <em>GRACE</em> you would be more appealing to employers in the labour market
                as you have more to offer them.

                As a mechanical engineer, I envisage myself as an Energy and Transportation sector specializing engineer. I give myselt this
                advice: There is definitely nothing to fear. Be it my fears, my peers, the unknown or the future yet to come. Not even
                the circumstances I find myself in or my challenges. I am more than a conqueror and my father is bigger than Odogwu.

            </header>
            <p  class="answer" id="answer4">
                <!-- <hr> -->
                The answer to this question clearly, is Yes, gaining hands-on practice is a necessity. As one who knows what he wants which is
                definitely not becoming a lecturer, this practical experience will be used to <a href="/MAIN/ANY/Images/See third definition.png">leverage</a> in the professional space. Bible says "<em>seek and you shall find</em>".
                Because of that, if I seek for those practical experiences, God will perfect his word concerning me, Amen

                While it would be that the University system is more theoretical, a strong mindset bent on not conforming to that pattern
                backed up with actions tailored to it will do. Always seek for opportunities to break forth from it and surely you'll find
                that opportunities as consitency can never be unrewarded.

                Get as many mentors and connections as possible. Their use is emphasized in how they help you. That being said that it is 
                good to get this skills young, as to avoid cold feet later on, be on the lookout for opportunities and be BOLD, DARING
                enough to break away from any opposition and obstacle as your future is yours and yours alone.
