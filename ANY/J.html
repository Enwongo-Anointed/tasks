    <div class="first">
        <div class="text">
            <p>This actually is how life is though represented comically.</p>
            <p>This struggle at times gets frustrating especially at the point where you are about to take a break... </p>
            <p>...the next stage begins simultaneously throwing you off balance</p>

        <img src="/MAIN/ANY/Images/Dear God.jpg" alt="Only God can make it comfortable">
        <div class="text">
            <p>What came to mind at first is: "There's not really much to say"</p>
            <p>Actually, there's everything to say right here</p>
            <p>God is the source and the means by which my ends are met</p>

            <p>This belong's to one of my many bosses(mentors is the right name sha)</p>
            <p>This is my main devotion for now...</p>
            <p>...before I start climbing the seemingly little hill named 'COLLEGE'</p>
            <p>So help me God</p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>Unwinding is for real and trust me it's necessary</p>
            <p>I opt for Anime and movies</p>
            <p>I hope I don't stick to them...</p>
            <p>...when they are not needed</p>

    <h4>I'll take a break at this point...</h4>
    <p>Primarily because Javascript is well, just sooo... large</p>
    <p>Still I'll pull through because I'm not alone</p>
    <p>Nothing in life comes easily</p>
